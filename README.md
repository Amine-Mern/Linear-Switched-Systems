# Linear Switched Systems

## Linear Parameter Varying Systems : 

**Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) systems** are models used to represent systems whose dynamics depend on parameters that change over time, called scheduling signals. LPV models extend linear time-invariant systems by allowing these parameters to vary, enabling accurate modeling of nonlinear or time-varying processes while preserving a linear structure for analysis and identification. They are widely used in control and system identification due to their flexibility and practical relevance.

Under the right technical assumptions, any LPV can be decomposed into a
noiseless **deterministic linear parameter-varying (dLPV) system** which is driven only by the control input, and a **autonomous linear paramter-varying (asLPV)** system driven only by the noise. Moreover, the identification of these two subsystems can be carried out separately.

## Minimization of asLPV 
In this part of the project, we define what it means for an LPV (Linear Parameter-Varying) system to have a minimal state-space representation in innovation form. We present algebraic conditions to verify whether a asLPV state-space representation is minimal in forward innovation form and provide an algorithm to transform any stochastic asLPV model into a minimal innovation form.
